#   Django - Stripe Subscription Payment

We have successfully created a Django web application that allows users to subscribe to our service and view their plan. Our customers will also be automatically billed every month.

This is just the basics. You'll still need to:

Allow users to manage/cancel their current plan
Handle future payment failures
You'll also want to use environment variables for the domain_url, API keys, and webhook signing secret rather than hardcoding them.
